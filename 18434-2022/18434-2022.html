<p>
This is an undergraduate seminar in theoretical computer science. It carries CIM credit for the math department. As with all CIM subjects, the emphasis is on communication, both oral and written. Enrollment is limited by the department. 
The topic this spring is spectral graph theory with applications. Potential subtopics include random walks, graph partitioning, sparsification, coloring, random graphs, expanders, and myriad algorithmic and complexity-theoretic applications. Topics are flexible and applications of spectral methods and numerical linear algebra beyond graph theory are welcome. 


 </p>

<h4> Course Information </h4>
<p>
<b>Instructor:</b> <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~franks/">Cole&nbsp;Franks</a>. 
</p>
<p><a href ="http://web.mit.edu/ruff/www/">Susan Ruff</a>, ruff@math.mit.edu, is helping us with the communication aspects of the course.</p>

<p>
<b>When and where:</b> TTh 11-12:30 pm in 2-151
</p>

<p>
<b>Books:</b> I will send you links for materials as we need them, but we will start with the following.
<ol>
<li><a href ="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/2WF02/spectra.pdf"><i>Spectra of graphs </i> </a> by Brouwer and Haemers.
</li>
<li><a href ="https://math.dartmouth.edu/~doyle/docs/walks/walks.pdf"><i>Random walks and electric networks </i> </a> by Doyle and Snell.
</li>
<li> Lecture notes from a course on <a href= "http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/561/">Spectral Graph Theory </a> taught at Yale by Dan Speilman.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><b>Websites:</b> Most information will be on <code>http://math.mit.edu/~franks/18.434.html</code> (this site). <a href="https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/12946"> Canvas </a> (<code>https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/12946</code>) will be used primarily for collecting assignments.
</p>

<p><b>Office hours:</b> Mostly by appointment, but there will be drop-in hours <b>Tues 3-4 in 2-181.</b> 

<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> A course in algorithms at the level of 6.046. Linear algebra will be helpful.</p>

<p><b>Assessment:</b> Everyone will be expected to give three talks (40%) and write a final paper (20%). The first two talks will be chalk talks, and the final talk will be a slide presentation for the final paper. Additionally, there will be a handful of problem sets to be typset in <a href="https://www.latex-project.org">LateX</a> (25%), and in-class participation (15%). In class partipation includes moderator duties. <b>Attendance is mandatory and more than 3 unexcused absences will result in failure.</b> You must visit <a href="https://studentlife.mit.edu/s3">S3</a> to have your absences excused, but this is not a guarantee. The more advanced notice you can give me about the absence, the more lenient I wil be. If you are required to isolate during a scheduled presentation, you can either present via Zoom (unless, of course, you are too ill to present) or help me try to find someone to switch with you. </p>

<h4>Guidelines for giving talks</h4>
<p>
The first two talks (the chalk talks) will be 35-40 minute talks about some topic or result from spectral graph theory or a related field. From the schedule below you'll see that presentation slots come with a suggested topic. I have tried to choose these so that there will be a clear result to take as the main focus. 

The goal of the talks is to teach the result and its proof to your colleagues. Your talk can be somewhat like a math lecture in a course, but should be self contained and well-motivated. The talk should contain, at the very least,

<ol>
	<li>An introduction explaining definitions and motivation for the result you will present. You should also mention your sources here. </li>
	<li>A statement and proof of the result or results which is understandable and engaging to your peers.
</ol>

Sources such as Brouwer and Haemers can often be very terse - simply rewriting what you find there won't suffice, because there are many omitted details. You may need to fill in these details yourself or use other sources to do so - if you do use other sources, make sure to mention them. You are welcome to use other sources also to find motivation or better proofs for the results, and you are also welcome to ask me about anything you are struggling with.

I'll also ask you to share your talk notes with me so I can share with the rest of the class in case they need them for the psets.
</p>



<h4>Tentative Schedule</h4>
<p>
We will start with Chapters 1-6 of Haemers. From there we will move to Doyle and Snell, and then we will fill in the rest with Spielman and other sources. 
</p>

If for some reason you can't stand your topic you can come to me with another idea or choose from this (hopefully growing) list of extra topics. They tend to be more advanced than the topics in the schedule. What ties these additional topics together is the appearance of spectra of matrices in computer science and machine learning. The topics no one selects here can in some cases make good final presentation topics! If you have seen something elsewhere you think may qualify, please bring it to my attention.
<ol>
	<li><a href="https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~z-furedi/PUBS/furedi_komlos_cca1981_random_eig.pdf">Eigenvalues of random symmetric matrices</a></li>
	<li>Linear size sparsifiers, Spielman 18</li>
	<li>Matrix completion, <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/recht11a/recht11a.pdf"> Benjamin Recht </a></li>
	<li>Hubs and authorities; <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/auth.pdf"> Kleinberg's HITs algorithm </a></li>
	<li> Principal components analysis; Chapter 1 of Ravi Kannan's <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~vempala/spectralbook.pdf">"Spectral algorithms"</a></li>
	<li> Higher order Cheeger inequalities and clustering: <a href = "https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~lapchi/cs860-2019/notes/L04.pdf"> Lau </a></li>
	<li> Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma for dimensionality reduction, e.g. <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/mmahoney/cs369m/Lectures/lecture1.pdf">Mahoney </a>

</ol>

For the second round of talks, I'll be marking talks that require more background learning as <mark class="pink">advanced</mark>.

<h3>Final project</h3>

The final project will be a 4-6 page writeup covering a result related to spectral graph theory, plus a short (20 minute) slide presentation at the end of the semester. The topics listed below are only suggestions; you may have to look around a bit to find a suitable final topic. The goal of your writeup is not to regurgitate proofs but rather to explain the key ideas of the work without getting bogged down in the details. 

<b>You may, if you wish, choose to work in groups of 2.</b> If you choose this option, your length is instead 8-10 pages and your final presentation length is 30 minutes rather than 20 minutes.

<h4> Expectations for first draft </h4>

<p> The first draft should be at minimum a 1-2 page summary (2-3 if group) consisting of the following: </p>
<ol>
<li> the main result in the paper you are writing about.</li>
<li> the significance of this result.</li>
<li> A sketch of the proof - this could consist of the main lemmas involved in the proof together with some guiding text about why they are true and how they fit together to prove the main result. This sketch should reflect, at a minimum, that you have read and understood the material.</li>
<li> A paragraph at the end stating what details you will fill in to make the full 4-6 page doc (or 8-10 if you are a group). </li>
</ol>


<h4> Second draft rubric </h4>
Here's the second draft rubric, which also explains how the final will be graded.
<a href="2nd-draft-rubric.pdf">2nd draft rubric</a>


<h4> Possible final topics: </h4>
 Here is a list of suggestions. Some are very broad/ambitious; discuss with me so we can narrow down the source material. You can also provide your own topic or use topics we didn't cover, subject to my approval. It is also possible for people to present different results in the same topic but you must discuss with me to make sure there is not too much overlap. There is also a page of topic suggestions for a <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~trevisan/cs359g/projects.html"> course by Trevisan.</a>
