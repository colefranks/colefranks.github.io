\handout{Spanning Tree Game}{\today}

A spanning tree $T$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a set of edges without any
cycles that connect all vertices together. The spanning tree game is a
2-player game. Each player in turn selects an edge. Player 1 starts by
deleting an edge, and then player 2 fixes an edge (which has not been
deleted yet); an edge fixed
cannot be deleted later on by the other player. Player 2 wins if he
succeeds in constructing a spanning tree of the graph; otherwise,
player 1 wins. 

Which graphs have a winning strategy for player 1? Which graphs have a
winning strategy for player 2?

For this graph with 16 vertices and 30 edges, which player has a
winning strategy?
