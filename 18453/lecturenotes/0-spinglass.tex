Consider the
$7\times 7$ grid drawn below, where each edge has been made thick (solid) or thin (dashed). Given an assigment of
signs (+ or -) to the vertices of this grid, a thick edge is {\it violated} if the endpoints have two different signs. A thin edge is violated if the endpoints have identical signs. The goal is to find an assignment of signs which minimize
the total number of violations in the grid.

As you'll probably realize, although finding a ``good'' assignment of
signs might not be that difficult, providing a proof  that your
solution is optimal is in fact much more challenging (and a short proof exists for any instance).
