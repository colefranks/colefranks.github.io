Consider the
$7\times 7$ grid drawn below. Given an assigment of
signs (+ or -) to the vertices of this grid, a {\it violation}
corresponds to either a thick (solid) edge with two different signs at its
endpoints or a  thin (dashed) edge with identical signs at its
endpoints. The goal is to find an assignment of signs which minimize
the total number of violations in the grid.

As you'll probably realize, although finding a ``good'' assignment of
signs might not be that difficult, providing a proof  that your
solution is optimal is in fact much more challenging (and a short proof exists for any instance).
